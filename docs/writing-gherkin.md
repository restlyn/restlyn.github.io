Feature: Title of the feature

  Scenario: Title of the test case
    Given base URL is "https://api.example.com"
    When I POST "/login" with:
      | email    | test@example.com |
      | password | secret           |
    Then response status should be 200
    And response body should contain key "token"
```

## ‚ôªÔ∏è Reusable Steps

Define reusable steps in `stepLibrary.js` like:
```js
module.exports = {
  'I am logged in': {
    steps: [
      { method: 'POST', endpoint: '/login', body: { email: 'test@example.com', password: 'secret' }, extract: ['token'] }
    ]
  }
}
```
Then reference in feature:
```gherkin
When I am logged in
```
